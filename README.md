# Netflix-Tableau-Project

> **Note:** This project was built while following a YouTube tutorial to practice and learn Tableau dashboard design and data storytelling concepts. The goal was to understand the techniques and apply them. Any modifications or experiments I made are my own.

## Overview

Analyzing Netflix’s movie and TV show catalog using Tableau. The dashboard visualizes trends in content type, genre popularity, ratings, release years, and geographic distribution.
